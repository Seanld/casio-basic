# casio-basic

I like the Casio Basic scripting language, so I decided to try and make a simple interpreter for it in Python. May eventually port over to C++.

## Roadmap:

- Stage 1:
	- Single-character variables
		- Storing them
		- Reading them
	- Math operations
		- Multiplication, addition, subtraction, division (to start with)
	- Simple I/O
		- `Locate` command, for writing characters to specific location on screen
		- `ClearText` command, for erasing the screen
		- `?` command, to get input from the user
- Stage 2:
	- Lists
	- While loop
	- Label/Goto
- Stage 3:
	T.B.D.
